Meow Hello, Welcome to catifier.
A simple web application that allows users to insert phrases, quotes, terms, sentences or words and watch them become catified! Meow! 

# Description
So I wrote an awesome meow-lgorithim that takes in a string of text, loops through each word and letter of the text, looks for opportunities to 'catify' specific phrases (based on my kitty-cat pun research), and flashes the new catified version of the text back to the user to be shared with the world.
